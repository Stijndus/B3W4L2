    <h2>Le Mans</h2>
    <p>With a 4 mile straight which lets cars reach speeds of nearly 260mph and drivers that are probably exhausted
        during involvement with the famous 24 hour race, you'd probably expect a serious smash or two. Le Mans still
        retains the title of the scene of the world's worst motor racing incident which killed between 80 and 100
        spectators and injured 120 after Pierre Levagh hit an earth bank which flipped his car right into spectators'
        paths. After the incident, many Europen tracks were closed because of a ban until they were made safer. To this
        day, Switzerland still have the ban in place.</p>
