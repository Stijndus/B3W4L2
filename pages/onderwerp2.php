    <h2>Nurnburgring</h2>
    <p><i>'The Green Hell'</i> as Sir Jackie Stewart calls it, is 12.7 miles long and has 73 corners (a strangely disputed
        fact). A lot of supercar and hot hatch manufacturers have been using it as a proving ground to boast about their
        record-breaking vehicles. Anyone in any car can go round it for a fee of â‚¬24 euros a lap. This is what makes it
        dangerous; lots of amateurs in cars and bikes thinking they know one of the longest tracks in the world when in
        reality, they don't. In public sessions alone, there are an estimated 3-12 deaths a year. It doesn't help that
        there are steep embankments right next to the track. So if you make a mistake, it will hurt. Oh, and the
        carousel.</p>
